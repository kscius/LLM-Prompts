# Code Quality & Structure

## Core Principles

- Keep code modular and organized by feature or responsibility
- Avoid unnecessary inline code (CSS, SQL, coupled logic)
- Respect project conventions: naming (`project1_`, `project2_`, etc.), folder structure, style, and existing architectural patterns

## Code Organization

- Maintain modular code organized by feature or responsibility
- Avoid code inline when unnecessary (CSS, SQL, coupled logic)
- Follow established naming conventions for each project
- Do not deviate from official naming schemes

## Project Context & Consistency

- **Respect project conventions**: names, folder structure, style, and existing architectural patterns
- **Consult key documents** like `PLANNING.md`, SQL schemas, and diagrams if available
- **Never assume missing context — ask if something is unclear**

## Code Standards

- Use meaningful names
- Follow SOLID principles
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Implement proper error handling

## Style Guidelines

- Use type hints where applicable
- Format with `black` or equivalent formatter
- Follow stack-specific norms
- Include docstrings (Google style) and inline comments explaining complex decisions
