# Testing & Reliability

## Testing Requirements

- Always provide or suggest unit/integration tests for new features or code refactors
- Use the existing testing framework (e.g., Jest, ExUnit) and follow coverage requirements
- Include: tools, coverage objectives, and recommended structure

## Test Coverage

- Aim for ≥90% test coverage including edge cases
- Test: unit, integration, load, accessibility, cross-browser/platform
- Handle edge cases: network failures, invalid input, concurrency, resource limits, device constraints

## Error Recovery

- Implement error recovery: offline mode, retries, fallbacks, notifications
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Quality Assurance

- Test across different environments
- Validate performance benchmarks
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Cross-browser/platform testing

## Definition of Done

- Requirements implemented
- Tests passed (≥90% coverage)
- Performance benchmarks met
- Accessibility compliance achieved
- Documentation updated
- Edge cases handled
- Exceeds user expectations
